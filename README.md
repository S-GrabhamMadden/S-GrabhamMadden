Hello, I'm Si√¥n!

My interests in software include research applications (particularly in machine learning), game development, and finding web solutions for finance and other sectors. I'm also a fan of FOSS.

Over 2022, I finished an honours project that used convolutional neural networks and transformers to break down the vocalisations of rats into syllable-like structures, for transcription. I'm now working with Sunny Side Up in Wellington on web development, largely in the Silverstripe ecosystem.

You can reach me by email.
